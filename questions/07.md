# Scope: Scope Chain

When our JavaScript code is run in the browser, the JavaScript engine actually
makes two separate passes over our code: **compilation** and **execution**.

Match each of these concepts with the correct description.

## Correct

- Compilation Phase
- Allocates memory, sets up references to variables, and adds a reference to the
appropriate scope chain for functions

## Correct

- Execution Phase
- Runs our code line-by-line, assigning values to variables and calling functions
