# Scope: Lexical Scoping

What variables does the **innerFunc** have access to?

```
const var1 = 1; 
function outerFunc (var2 = 2) { 
  const var3 = 2; 
  function innerFunc(){ 
    const var4 = 4 
  } 
  return var1 + var2; 
}
```

## Correct

var1, var2, var3, var4

> Correct!
> 
> Thanks to JavaScript's scope rules, the innerFunc has access to all the
> variables.

## Incorrect

var2, var3, var4

> Because var1 is a global variable, we have access to it everywhere in our
> program.

## Incorrect

I don't know.
