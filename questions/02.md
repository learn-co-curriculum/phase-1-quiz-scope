# Scope: Lexical Scoping

What variables does `innerFunc` have access to?

```javascript
const var1 = 1;
function outerFunc(var2 = 2) {
  const var3 = 2;
  function innerFunc() {
    const var4 = 4;
  }
  return var1 + var2;
}
```

## Correct

`var1`, `var2`, `var3`, `var4`

> Correct!
> 
> Thanks to JavaScript's scope rules, `innerFunc` has access to all the variables.

## Incorrect

`var2`, `var3`, `var4`

> Because `var1` is a global variable, we have access to it everywhere in our
> program.

## Incorrect

I don't know.

> Be sure to study the source/s for this question. You'll get it next time.
