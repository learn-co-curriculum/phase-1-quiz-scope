# Scope: Scope Chain

Given this JavaScript code:

```javascript
function oneAndOne() {
  const num1 = 1;
  const num2 = 2;
  return num1 + num2;
}
oneAndOne();

console.log(num1);
```

The `console.log` method on the last line will log the number 1.

## Incorrect

True

> Since `num1` is declared **inside** the `oneAndOne` function, it cannot be
> accessed from the global scope.

## Correct

False

> Nailed it! Since `num1` is declared **inside** the `oneAndOne` function, it
> cannot be accessed from the global scope.
