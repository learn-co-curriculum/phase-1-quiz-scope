# Scope: Lexical Scoping

What variables does the **outerFunc** have access to?

```
const var1 = 1; 
function outerFunc (var2 = 2) { 
  const var3 = 2; 
  function innerFunc(){ 
    const var4 = 4 
  } 
  return var1 + var2; 
}
```

## Correct

var1, var2, var3

> Correct!
> 
> We have access to everything except var4, because it is declared within the
> scope of innerFunc.

## Incorrect

var1, var2, var3, var4

> Functions don't have access to the variables declared within the scope of the
> functions declared within them.

## Incorrect

var2, var3

> var1 is a global variable, making it available everywhere!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
