# Scope: Lexical Scoping

What variables does `outerFunc` have access to?

```javascript
const var1 = 1;
function outerFunc(var2 = 2) {
  const var3 = 2;
  function innerFunc() {
    const var4 = 4;
  }
  return var1 + var2;
}
```

## Correct

`var1`, `var2`, `var3`

> Correct!
> 
> We have access to everything except `var4`, because it is declared within the
> scope of `innerFunc`.

## Incorrect

`var1`, `var2`, `var3`, `var4`

> Functions don't have access to the variables declared within the scope of the
> functions declared within them, so `var4` is not available to `outerFunc`

## Incorrect

`var2`, `var3`

> `var1` is a global variable, making it available everywhere!

## Incorrect

I don't know.
